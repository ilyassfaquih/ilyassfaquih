## Hi there 👋

I am a Software Engineer who believes that great code solves real-world problems. Specializing in Java and Angular, I build end-to-end solutions that streamline processes and enhance user engagement.

Throughout my career, I have leveraged the power of Java for secure, high-performance back-end processing while utilizing Angular’s modularity to create intuitive Single Page Applications (SPAs). I enjoy the challenge of debugging complex systems and the satisfaction of deploying a feature that makes a user's life easier.

I am currently looking for opportunities to apply my full-stack skills to challenging projects that require both analytical thinking and creative UI implementation.

Core Competencies: Full Stack Development, API Integration, Database Management, java/angular
